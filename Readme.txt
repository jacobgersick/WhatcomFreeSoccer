I am in the process of learning HTML and CSS from scratch, and for a pet project I want to create a website for organizing free, pick-up soccer in my county. 

A little backstory:

This has been a dream of mine since I lived in Portland, Oregon 10 years ago. Some people managed a Facebook group that held around 5,000 members, and every day of you could find a pick-up game of soccer in the city for all skill levels.
It really stuck with me that soccer should be free and open to anyone. So here I am now hoping to recreate that magic in my new home far from Portland, without using the big, bad Facebook.
